# Can I be Banned For Using Genshin Interactive Map?

_Kongying Tavern Genshin Interactive Map_ is a MulanPSL-1.0 open-source project, the original intent behind its development is to have stress-free fun in Genshin Impact. This tool is not and will never be a third-party cheating software, it will not read nor edit game data and does not engage in any process that undermines Genshin Impact's terms of service.
